# Git Workshop Week 1
`git` is an extremely powerful tool that is used as a form of version control during the software development lifecycle, in laymen terms--it's how software is created in the real world. During week one of the tutorial we will learn all of the basic commands of `git` that you will need in order to keep track of your code for your school projects. Specifically, in this tutorial we will be covering: 
- How to create a repository on GitHub
- How to clone a remote repository to your computer (`git clone`)
- How to create a README
- How to create a file
- How to stage a file for a commit (`git add`)
- How to create a commit using (`git commit`)
- How to push up files to the remote repository (`git push`)

## Creating a repository on GitHub
Whenever you're starting a new project whether for school or for personal use, one of the first steps you should take is creating an empty repository on your remote version control system to keep track of your code (Github in our example). Version control is an extremely powerful tool that helps teams create software quickly and keep track of their changes. For you, you could start using it right now to keep track of your school projects to start practicing `git` fundamentals or even more importantly, to keep a backup of your code if anything were to ever happen to your computer.
